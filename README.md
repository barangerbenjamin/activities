# Implement Pundit

This is your playground to implement Pundit.
The home page is the index action of the activity controller.
You can see all the activities on this page.

You have to login to use the app, there is 3 users:
- login: arne@lewagon.com password: 123456
- login: inge@lewagon.com password: 123456
- login: manuel@lewagon.com password: 123456

Running the seed will clean the database, create 3 users (see above) and 2 activities per user.

The current state of the app allows you to delete another user's activity. Try to implement pundit to block this!

If you have an issue with the DB, feel free to re-seed to restart fresh!
